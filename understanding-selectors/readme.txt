Why are ID selectors a bad idea? 
 - They can be difficult if you’re using several ID’s to target several items. Also, they can dominate styles, which can cause conflicts with HTML and the web browser. Elements can belong to many classes, but only have one ID, so an established and understandable naming convention should be preferred.

What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
 - Inputs, elements/div, attributes
